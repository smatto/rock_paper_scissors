rock paper scissors game
Javascript HTML CSS

This is based on the one in the Codecademy JS lessons.
But holy crap there are a lot of ways to do this by smarter people than me http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17976883/rock-paper-scissors-in-javascript

To Do:
//get output and prompts to write to html, not popups
XX render choices and results as HTML5 drawn canvas elements
    HTML5 canvas elements are not tracked for event listening, need to learn a framework for this such as http://kineticjs.com/
//make clickable images for user choice input, play onclick
//add point counter for wins/losses
make win percentage produce some visible effect on page animation
